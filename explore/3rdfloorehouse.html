A pocket square is tucked into the pocket on their left breast. They are framed by various drops of water, most of them are painted in with blue but the outlying ones appear to just be painted linework.">

The face is primarly green with swathes of purple about their cheeks, their lips are a grey blue, and their eyes are a dark red with their iris a shocking yellow to contrast.

The orange sky lit by a yellow sun, blue and purple shadowed clouds frame the sky portion of the mural and are across the sky as a whole.">
