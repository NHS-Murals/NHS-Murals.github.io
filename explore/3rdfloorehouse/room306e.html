        <h3>3RD FLOOR, E HOUSE, ROOM 306E</h3>
        <p>Most, if not all of these small pieces in Room 306E, the art room, are Senior Squares, a way for departing seniors to make one final mark on this school. Started by a previous art teacher at Norwalk High, Mary Quinlan, who unfortunately passed in 2024, this tradition is still carried on by the current (at the time of this writing) art teacher and a student of Ms. Quinlan, Lauren Delong (who also provided this great background information as well as permission to capture her room, thanks Ms. Delong!).</p>
        <p>Due to the sheer amount of these squares, descriptions cannot be provided.</p>

Spiraling clockwise: a mural depicting Dory, a regal blue tang fish from Disney's Finding Nemo franchise alongside some bubbles; a mural with a stylized depiction of Harry Potter's head, a pale-skinned boy with dark hair and glasses as well as a notable lightning-bolt-shaped mark, next to a quote attributed to Albus Dumbledore, another character from the Harry Potter franchise: It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. Above this quote is a circle in a triangle, bisected in the middle by a line: the symbol of the Deathly Hallows; a mural of a window opening into a view of a waterfall flanked by hills with yellow trees; a mural of a dreamcatcher against a bright yellow background, the quote attributed to Walt Disney above it reads: All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them; a mural of a dock's silhouette in front of a ocean with pink and orange hues; a mural of a caricaturized Donald Trump holding up a censored middle finger, stylized as if it was grafitti on a brick wall complete with tags that surround him like: MERICA and TRUMP; a mural depicting various characters from the Ghibli movie Spirited Away, the centerpiece of which is a sleek white dragon, most likely Haku, with a dark blue mane that stretches to their tail-end, a peach underbelly, yellow horns and avian feet, and blue eyes. A small black bird, Haedori, carrying a chubby grey mouse, likely Boh is by the dragon's back and a Soot Sprite, a small fuzzy black creature, holds up a star-shaped konpeitō candy is by the dragon's tail; and a mural depicting Rick, an old man with spiky blue hair pale, almost grey skin in a lab coat, and Morty, a young boy with brown hair and pale skin in a yellow shirt, from the titular Adult Swim show, against a starry background. Rick is literally, grotesquely, opening Morty's eyes.">
