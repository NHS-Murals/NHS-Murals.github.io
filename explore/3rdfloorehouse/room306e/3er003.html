          <h3>Untitled (Door with assorted murals)</h3>
          <p>Various artists (2010-18)</p>
          <p><b>Located: </b>3rd Floor, E House, Room 306E</p>
        </div>
        <p>The door of room 306E with assorted murals painted on and near it. Spiraling clockwise: a mural depicting Dory, a regal blue tang fish from Disney's Finding Nemo franchise alongside some bubbles; a mural with a stylized depiction of Harry Potter's head, a pale-skinned boy with dark hair and glasses as well as a notable lightning-bolt-shaped mark, next to a quote attributed to Albus Dumbledore, another character from the Harry Potter franchise: "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Above this quote is a circle in a triangle, bisected in the middle by a line: the symbol of the Deathly Hallows; a mural of a window opening into a view of a waterfall flanked by hills with yellow trees; a mural of a dreamcatcher against a bright yellow background, the quote attributed to Walt Disney above it reads: "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them"; a mural of a dock's silhouette in front of a ocean with pink and orange hues; a mural of a caricaturized Donald Trump holding up a censored middle finger, stylized as if it was grafitti on a brick wall complete with tags that surround him like: MERICA and TRUMP; a mural depicting various characters from the Ghibli movie Spirited Away, the centerpiece of which is a sleek white dragon, most likely Haku, with a dark blue mane that stretches to their tail-end, a peach underbelly, yellow horns and avian feet, and blue eyes. A small black bird, Haedori, carrying a chubby grey mouse, likely Boh, is by the dragon's back and a Soot Sprite, a small fuzzy black creature, holds up a star-shaped konpeit≈ç candy is by the dragon's tail; and a mural depicting Rick, an old man with spiky blue hair pale, almost grey skin in a lab coat, and Morty, a young boy with brown hair and pale skin in a yellow shirt, from the titular Adult Swim show, against a starry background. Rick is literally, grotesquely, opening Morty's eyes.</p>
        <p><b>Notes:</b> There's too many murals both signed and unsigned and unsigned but dated in this one so I'll just list all what I can gather here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dory mural was signed by an Imelda '17</li>
            <li>Harry Potter mural was signed by Clara Lorenzo '18 and a Sam B.</li>
            <li>Window mural is unsigned and undated from what I could tell.</li>
            <li>Trump mural was dated '17 but I can't read the what's presumably the signature(s) below the date. Please reach out if you can or just know anything about it.</li>
            <li>Dock mural was signed by an AT '10.</li>
            <li>Dreamcatcher mural is unsigned but dated on 2010.</li>
            <li>Sprited Away mural is unsigned and undated.</li>
            <li>Rick and Morty mural was signed by Arlyn Muralles '17.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Harry Potter quote is specifically from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, first published on 1998<sup>[1]</sup> and the Walt Disney quote is compiled in Pat Williams' How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Magic Every Day of Your Life, published on 2004.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
        <p>Please reach to me if you have any idea who AT and Imelda could be, thanks!</p>
