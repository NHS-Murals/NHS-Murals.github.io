        <h3>About The Archive</h3>
        <p>The Norwalk High School Mural Preservation Project is Marianne Joy Montenegro and Daniel Guo's capstone project, but beyond that, it is her sincere attempt at recording history. This site is mainly directed at preserving the murals of Norwalk High School's walls before the building's demolition to make room for the new one.</p>
        <p>Norwalk has had a long history of murals and public art, in fact, our city hall (which, incidentally, was Norwalk High School's old building) holds one of the largest collections of Depression-era art (which, also incidentally, is mostly made up of murals). Other notable areas painted with some impressive murals that bring this town to life would have to be Wall St. and it's surrounding avenues, Calf Pasture Beach, and the Belden Ave. Norwalk Library Branch to name a few. Think of this website as a way of homage to our little city's history.</p>
        <p>But why preserve it beyond duty? Norwalk High School isn't a particularly notable school (no offense!) beyond the boundaries of the surrounding area and its insides aren't any more notable either. Well, the art of an era can tell us a whole lot about it, from its values, ideals, and culture. The art of a high school is no different. The permanence (well, up untl recently) of these murals peppered about the school's walls paints a record of what the students of Norwalk valued, hoped, and liked this is most evident when you compare murals from the 1990s to the 2020s. This site is but a mere record of a record.</p>
        <p>Personally though, what I'd really hope to see this site being used for is as reference, not just in a historical sense, but in an artistic one too. I hope that some student-muralist in the future trying to make their mark on that new school will stumble on to this little old site and find kinship and inspiration in some long demolished murals. I hope that whoever they are, they'll realize that we will always have this shared desire to leave a reminder of our existence somewhere and that someone, somewhere will appreciate it.</p>

        <h3>Limitations...</h3>
        <h4>in image hosting:</h4>
        <p>While publishing this site, we found it difficult to display high-quality photos without transmitting excessive data. Our phone cameras (yes, phone cameras — we do not have access to a high-quality camera) default to the .HEIF format. While efficient, this format isn't universally supported by major browsers. The popular lossless .PNG format requires a large amount of data to transmit, so we initially tried using .WebP. However, its quality-to-data savings ratio wasn't ideal, leading us to switch to .AVIF — a format designed to supersede .WebP and supported by major browsers.</p>
        <p>To further reduce data usage, the images on this site are displayed at half the resolution of the original .HEIF files.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to view the original-quality photos, please check out the Google Photos albums through the links below! (add links later)</p>
        <h4>in artwork preservation:</h4>
        <p>Preservation via phone cameras is also an imperfect method for archiving artwork, as it fails to capture fine details (like small brushstrokes) and accurate colors as the artist intended.</p>

        <h3>About The Webmasters</h3>
        <p>Marianne Joy D. Montenegro is the person coding, upkeeping, and yapping on this website. She launched the Norwalk High School Mural Preservation Project as the Capstone Project required for her graduation, but also because she's a bit of a hoarder and doesn't know how let things go. At the time of this writing, she is currently a junior in P-TECH Norwalk (within NHS's walls) and pursuing an associate's in Mobile Development as part of the school's dual-enrollment program. Her favorite subject in school is English and Civics if you couldn't already tell. Beyond academics, she is associated with various advocacy groups working to better her community as well has indulging in her hobbies of reading, writing, and pursuing other creative pursuits.</p>
        <p>Daniel Guo has assisted Marianne in photographing the murals and handled all the image conversions for the site. He is currently a senior at NHS and is interested in pursuing a major in STEM, particularly technology.</p>
