        <h3>Welcome to the Norwalk High School Mural Preservation Project!</h3>
              
        <p>This site is a digital archive of Norwalk High School's many murals. With the impending demolition of the school's current building to make way for the new one, we find it necessary to catalog the murals that have given this old school of ours so much character and life. We intend for this website to not only serve as a record of our school's history but also as a way to show appreciation for the work these artists have put so much passion and effort into.</p> 
        <p>The archives can be accessed through the Explore tab in the navigation menu above. Please enjoy the archives and thanks for stopping by!</p>
